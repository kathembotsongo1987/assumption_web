                Elected in 1846 and hailed as a liberal-minded pope, Pius IX, previously known as Giovanni Maria Mastai Ferretti (1792-1878), quickly evolved toward intransigence regarding modern 
                ideas as a result of the political events that were taking place in Italy. Father d’Alzon can be considered an intimate friend of both his person and his ideas. Father d’Alzon met 
                him several times in private audience: May 18, 1855 at Castelgandolfo, then in Rome on May 29, 1855, May 27, 1862, June 3, 1862 (public audience), June 6, 1862 (private audience),

                the Church’s political influence in traditionally Catholic countries: Italy (1831-1832; 1870); France (1879, the Third Republic which was strongly anticlerical); Spain (after the fall 
                of Isabella II in 1868 and during the anticlerical wave from 1873 to 1875); but also in certain Protestant countries: Switzerland (the Sonderbund  in 1848 and the exile of Bishop Mermillod 
                1873-1883), Prussia (Bismarck’s Kulturkampf  1871-1878). However, the Catholic Church also found a new audience in several
