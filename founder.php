                <p>The first day we started our formation, one of first things I was encouraged to do first, was to go through the Facebook page for Living with Christ in comparison with other ecclesiastical Facebook pages. Honestly speaking, the page was very down, it was reached by few people not more a maximum of 15 to 20 people. Engagement could not go beyond 5. One of questions that would come directly to mind was to know why was the page not reached good number of people?

                       of tutors. From 1823 to 1828 d'Alzon studied at the renowned Parisian colleges of Lycée Louis-le-Grand and Collège Stanislas de Paris.
                        It was at the end of his secondary studies that he came into contact with the influential thinker, Félicité de Lamennais, much of whose 
                        early teachings on the political order and Christian society would mark the young d'Alzon. In 1828 d'Alzon enrolled in law school in Paris but never finished because

                  .....A frequent visitor to Rome, d'Alzon had a meeting with Pope Pius IX in 1862 that would have a profound effect on him and his young congregation. Encouraged by the pope,
                     he visited Constantinople and soon thereafter decided to invest much of his time, energy, and resources in addressing the needs of the Church in Eastern Europe. As with his concerns to convert Protestants, d'Alzon wished to win back Orthodox Christians to Rome, so profound was his desire for the unity of Church, as he saw it. Within a few years he had sent some of his first religious to Bulgaria and eventually to Romania and Turkey (after his death communities would be established in the Holy Land, Russia, Greece,and Yugoslavia). </h3>
